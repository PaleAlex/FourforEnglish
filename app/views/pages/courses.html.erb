        <p class="text-justify">Among the many proposals for English language courses, I would like to help you understand how to choose the truly effective ones. Speaking the language does not imply knowing how to teach it.
          My suggestion would be to first pay attention to the years of experience of whom will be teaching you English.
          Furthermore, do some research on the professorâ€™s International teaching experience to different countries because it is likely that through this experience teachers develop better skills in understanding the student and the many difficulties involved in learning a foreign language.
          Finally, verify the results achieved and the degree of the student satisfaction and their improvement. All this is important when choosing an English course.
